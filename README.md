# Mapping_Earthquakes
 Use JavaScript, Leaflet, GeoJSON, and mapbox to create mobile-friendly interactive earthquake maps. 

## Overview of Project

### Background

Phase1 of this project used Leaflet to create a street-view and satellite-view map with an otpional overlay of earthquake data from quakes over the past 7 days. The overlay data includes circle markers and the quake location that were sized and colored according to quake magnitude. The map contains a control to toggle the overlay and map view, as well as a legend to explain the color used to represent each magnitude. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to expand on the map created in Phase1 to include visualization of tectonic plates, and deliverables below. 

### Deliverables
 - Add tectonic plate data
 - Add all earthquakes with > 4.5 magnitude
 - Add an additional map

### Resources
 - Data Sources: [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/)
 - Technology: JavaScript, Leaflet library, D3 library, GeoJSON, mapbox
